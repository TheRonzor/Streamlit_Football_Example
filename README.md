# Streamlit_Football_Example

This repo is public, but was only intended for a couple folks. If you landed here and don't know why, have fun, but don't ask me about it!

To run the app from the command line:

```python
streamlit run main.py
```
_Note that I did not include any pipenv/virtualenv setup files for this, so just ```pip install``` any libraries you get errors about not having (most likely, streamlit)_

### Other files and directories:

- UsageExamples_Data.ipynb: Simple examples working with the database
- UsageExamples_Viz.ipynb: Simple examples working with the visualization
- data/ : A directory containing the data and database
- src/: A directory containing the code that makes stuff work.  Keep it out of the main directory so we don't confuse people.
